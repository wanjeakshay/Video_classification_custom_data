# Video_classification_custom_data
We are using tensorflow and keras to do Video classification. It is a multiclass Classification using custom dataset.


## Dataset

Train- Training dataset contains 3 folders.

  a) eating

  b) drinking

  c) smoking



Test- Testing dataset contains 3 folders.

  a) eating

  b) drinking

  c) smoking
  
  
We have to find out if a person is eating, drinking or smoking. We have used Inception v3 for multiclass classification, you can use any other state of art algorithm or pretrained model to do so.
Let's get started !!
